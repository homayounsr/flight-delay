## Conclusion
All the goals for the SQL project were met and we were clearly able to distinguish the top most profitable Airbnb accommodations in Montr√©al based on their availability in a month. We were able to gather a list of all accommodations with poor ratings for cleanliness that might flare a potential start-up for entrepreneurs who are looking into investing in complementary businesses related to Airbnb. We were able to filter the top most-rated listings for clients who are looking for 5-star accommodations. Also, we were able to add more queries that might possibly help customers in their decision-making.
